GINGE - Ginge Is Not GP2X Emulator

About
-----

Ginge is an application that can run many GP2X F100/F200 games on other ARM
Linux platforms, which currently includes Wiz. It is not a full hardware
emulator like MAME, PicoDrive or similar, it does not emulate the CPU. It can
be considered as compatibility layer similar to Wine on PC Linux, however it
does emulate small portion of MMSP2 system-on-chip. It operates by hooking
certain system calls and using realtime patching of code that accesses memory
mapped hardware directly.


Usage
-----

Ginge comes with a launcher that is started when you run Ginge. The launcher
can then be used to start GP2X software, which will either run if it's
compatible, or just return back to the menu if it is not. In some cases it
might hang though.


Structure
---------

Ginge actually consists of 4 independent executables and a few scripts:

+ ginge_sloader - loader of static executables
+ ginge_dyn     - dynamic executable handler
+ ginge_prep    - .gpe parser that selects the right handler from above
+ gp2xmenu      - the launcher/menu program
+ ginge_dyn.sh  - environment setup script for ginge_dyn
+ ginge.sh/gpe  - menu launcher script

The menu is optional and can be replaced or bypassed completely. The only thing
it does is running ginge_prep on GP2X .gpe program, ginge_prep handles the rest.
